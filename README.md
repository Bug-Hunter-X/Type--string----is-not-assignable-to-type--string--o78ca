This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function expecting a string. The function `greeter` expects a string argument, but we are passing an array of strings.  This results in a compilation error because TypeScript's type system prevents this incompatible assignment. The solution involves modifying the function or how the argument is passed to fix this type mismatch.
